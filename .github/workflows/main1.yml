    # ✅ Map secrets to env vars for CI
    env:
      INF_USER: ${{ secrets.INF_USER }}
      INF_PASS: ${{ secrets.INF_PASS }}

    steps:
      # 1️⃣ Checkout code
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # 2️⃣ Setup Node.js
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 18

      # 3️⃣ Install dependencies
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      # 4️⃣ Install Playwright browsers
      - name: Install Playwright browsers
        run: npx playwright install --with-deps

      # 5️⃣ Debug secrets (optional, remove after confirmation)
      - name: Check Secrets
        run: |
          [ -z "$INF_USER" ] && echo "INF_USER is EMPTY" || echo "INF_USER OK"
          [ -z "$INF_PASS" ] && echo "INF_PASS is EMPTY" || echo "INF_PASS OK"
          
      # 7️⃣ Upload HTML report
      - name: Upload Playwright report
        if: always()
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: playwright-report
          path: playwright-report

Secrets are mapped once in env: at the job level → available to all steps.

--repeat-each=10 runs all tests
